# 4. Let X = {aa, bb} and Y = {λ, b, ab}.
## a) List the strings in the set XY.

## b) How many strings of length 6 are there in X*?

## c) List the strings in the set Y* of length three or less

## d) List the strings in the set X*Y* of length four or less.


# 14. The set of strings over {a, b, c} in which all the a ’s precede the b's, which in turn precede the c’s. It is possible that there are no a ’s, b’s, or c’s.

# 15. The same set as Exercise 14 without the null string.

# 16. The set of strings over {a, b, c} with length three.
     {W|W = (a+b+c) (a+b+c) (a+b+c)}
# 17. The set of strings over {a, b, c} with length less than three.

# 18. The set of strings over {a, b,c} with length greater than three.
     {W|W = (a+b+c) (a+b+c) (a+b+c) (a+b+c)*}
# 19. The set of strings over {a, b} that contain the substring ab and have length greater than two.
     {W|W = (a+b)* (aab+aba+abb+bab) (a+b)*}
